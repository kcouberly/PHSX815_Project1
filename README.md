## How to use this code

## DiceRollAverage.py

Run with -h for list of possible inputs.

Input number of sides on die and number of experiments to run

Automatically overwrites and/or creates file 'output.txt'.

Creates a file that contains a list of average dice rolls based on the inputs.

Uses file Random.py to obtain categorical distribution (need Random.py file in same folder).

## Analysis.py

Run with -h for list of possible inputs.

Defaults to perform analysis on 'output.txt', can change this using -input.

Defaults to 6-sided die, change using -Nsides.

Creates histogram that shows distribution of averages.

Prints the number of times and probability of an average >= 5
